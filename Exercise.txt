Exercise
You are given height_weight.csv file which contains heights and weights of 1000 people. Dataset is taken from here, https://www.kaggle.com/mustafaali96/weight-height

You need to do this,

(1) Load this csv in pandas dataframe and first plot histograms for height and weight parameters

(2) Using IQR detect weight outliers and print them

(3) Using IQR, detect height outliers and print them



Exercise: Outlier removal using standard deviation and z score
You are given bhp.csv which contains property prices in the city of banglore, India. You need to examine price_per_sqft column and do following,

(1) Remove outliers using percentile technique first. Use [0.001, 0.999] for lower and upper bound percentiles

(2) After removing outliers in step 1, you get a new dataframe.

(3) On step(2) dataframe, use 4 standard deviation to remove outliers

(4) Plot histogram for new dataframe that is generated after step (3). Also plot bell curve on same histogram

(5) On step(2) dataframe, use zscore of 4 to remove outliers. This is quite similar to step (3) and you will get exact same result
